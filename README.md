# Guessing Game - Computer Agent
![Illustration of a computer trying to guess a secret number, with a thought bubble containing a question mark or a number.](https://github.com/AlliysonBonner/GuessingGameComputer/blob/main/image.png?raw=true)
This is a simple guessing game where the computer tries to guess the user's secret number. The user is prompted to enter the highest possible number that the computer can guess, and the computer will make random guesses and adjust its guessing range based on the user's feedback until it correctly guesses the user's number.

## Getting Started
